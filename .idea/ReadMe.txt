#This is to explain the Automation challenge in this project
#Ideally this project is an automation framework in progress. You will notice that I have created assets that I have not used, like configuration files (config.properties and Configuration.class). For the purpose of this exercise I have kept it simple.
#
#Assumption: It is assumed the reader is familiar with Intellij and already has an environment set up.
#This is a maven project with selenium WebDriver and TestNg and java 11.
#
#To run this test, you will need to create a new project from existing source version control - Git.
#This document is to be updated as need be.

This is a framework in progress. Ideally, for a real automation project I would use the  configuration file and the properties as well. I would use testrail to output my test results.
But for the purpose of this exercise I have only used two classes to implement this task. I honestly think this is enough to start a conversation.
Hope to meet you.
