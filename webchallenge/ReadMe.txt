#This is to explain the Automation challenge in this project
#Ideally this project is an automation framework in progress. You will notice that I have created assets that I have not used, like configuration files (config.properties and Configuration.class). For the purpose of this exercise I have kept it simple.
#
#Assumption: It is assumed the reader is familiar with Intellij and already has an environment set up.
#This is a maven project with selenium WebDriver and TestNg and java 11.
#
#To run this test, you will need to create a new project from existing source version control - Git.
#This document is to be updated as need be.
